## Survey Puffin

**Our MVP**

-A logged in user can create and take surveys.  
-A survey has many questions, a question has many possible answers, and logged in users can choose one answer from each question.  
-After a survey is taken, a the logged in user can see survey statistics and trends in a graph.

*Team Dynamics*  
-During this project, we used whiteboards and Trello for vertical slicing, team norms, and our schema.  
-Daily standups and frequent checkins were had, and 90s jams were played.
